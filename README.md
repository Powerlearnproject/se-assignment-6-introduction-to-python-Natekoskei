# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].

Answers
1: Python Basics:

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes readability and maintainability. 
Key features include:
Readable syntax: Python uses indentation to define blocks of code, making it easy to follow.
Extensive libraries: Python has a vast collection of libraries for tasks like data analysis, web development, and machine learning.
Cross-platform compatibility: Python runs on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Use Cases:
Python is used in a wide range of applications, including:
Data science: Data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.
Web development: Django and Flask are popular Python frameworks for building web applications.
Scripting: Python is often used to create scripts for automating tasks or interacting with system resources.

2 installing Python:
Windows:
Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Download the latest stable release.
Double-click the .exe file and follow the installation instructions.
MacOS:

Open the Terminal and run:
Brew install python
.PATH
may need to be updated.
Linux:

Sudo apt-get update
Sudo apt-get install python3
Verify Installation:
Run
Python --version
In the console.
Set up Virtual Environment:
Install virtualenv:
Pip install virtualenv
Create a virtual environment:
Virtualenv myvenv
Activate the environment:
Source myvenv/bin/activate
.
3 Python Syntax and Semantics:

Print ("Hello, World!")
Print ()
Is a function that prints a value to the console?
"Hello, World!"
Is a string literal enclosed in double quotes.

4 Data Types and Variables:
 Numeric: int, float, complex
Sequence: list, tuple, range
Mapping: dict
Set: set
Boolean: bool
x = 10  # int
y = 3.14  # float
my_list = [1, 2, 3]  # list
my_dict = {"name": "Nathan", "age": 27}  # dict

5 Control Structures:
Conditional Statements:

if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if condition is False
Loops:

for item in iterable:
    # Code to execute for each item in iterable

6 Functions in Python:
syntax
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b
result = sum(1, 2)  # Calls the sum function

7Lists and Dictionaries:
Lists: Ordered, mutable collections of elements.
Dictionaries: Unordered, mutable collections of key-value pairs.
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
8 Exception Handling:

try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    # Code to handle the exception
finally:
    # Code that always runs, regardless of whether an exception is raised
Modules and Packages:

9 Modules: Files containing Python code that can be imported into other scripts.
Packages: Collections of related modules.
import math  # Imports the math module
result = math.sqrt(2)  # Uses a function from the math module
File I/O:

10 # Read a file
with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()

# Write to a file
with open("file.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, World!")
