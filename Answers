1: Python Basics:

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes readability and maintainability. 
Key features include:
Readable syntax: Python uses indentation to define blocks of code, making it easy to follow.
Extensive libraries: Python has a vast collection of libraries for tasks like data analysis, web development, and machine learning.
Cross-platform compatibility: Python runs on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Use Cases:
Python is used in a wide range of applications, including:
Data science: Data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.
Web development: Django and Flask are popular Python frameworks for building web applications.
Scripting: Python is often used to create scripts for automating tasks or interacting with system resources.

2 installing Python:
Windows:
Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Download the latest stable release.
Double-click the .exe file and follow the installation instructions.
MacOS:

Open the Terminal and run:
Brew install python
.PATH
may need to be updated.
Linux:

Sudo apt-get update
Sudo apt-get install python3
Verify Installation:
Run
Python --version
In the console.
Set up Virtual Environment:
Install virtualenv:
Pip install virtualenv
Create a virtual environment:
Virtualenv myvenv
Activate the environment:
Source myvenv/bin/activate
.
3 Python Syntax and Semantics:

Print ("Hello, World!")
Print ()
Is a function that prints a value to the console?
"Hello, World!"
Is a string literal enclosed in double quotes.

4 Data Types and Variables:
 Numeric: int, float, complex
Sequence: list, tuple, range
Mapping: dict
Set: set
Boolean: bool
x = 10  # int
y = 3.14  # float
my_list = [1, 2, 3]  # list
my_dict = {"name": "Nathan", "age": 27}  # dict

5 Control Structures:
Conditional Statements:

if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if condition is False
Loops:

for item in iterable:
    # Code to execute for each item in iterable

6 Functions in Python:
syntax
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b
result = sum(1, 2)  # Calls the sum function

7Lists and Dictionaries:
Lists: Ordered, mutable collections of elements.
Dictionaries: Unordered, mutable collections of key-value pairs.
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
8 Exception Handling:

try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    # Code to handle the exception
finally:
    # Code that always runs, regardless of whether an exception is raised
Modules and Packages:

9 Modules: Files containing Python code that can be imported into other scripts.
Packages: Collections of related modules.
import math  # Imports the math module
result = math.sqrt(2)  # Uses a function from the math module
File I/O:

# Read a file
with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()

# Write to a file
with open("file.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, World!")
